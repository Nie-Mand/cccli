# Conventional Commits CLI

A CLI tool to help commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## Context

I was using the [Conventional Commits Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) for Visual Studio Code, and when I have started migrating to [Zed](https://zed.dev/), I have missed the extension. So, I have decided to create a CLI tool to replicate the extension behavior.
